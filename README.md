# Fast Food Fast

Fast food fast is a food delivery application.

## How it Works

- An admin creates food items
- A normal user creates an account and can login
- A logged in user can view available food items created by the admin
- A user chooses on a food item and makes an order
- An Admin can accept or reject the order request from a user
- A user gets notified on his/her order status
- Accepted orders are delivered
